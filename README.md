# runeLang
The worst idea ever: An esolang made in a conlang

## Keyboard
Basically to make this even more annoying to read, it uses a custom keyboard layout using unicode symbols that resemble the characters used by the conlang.

## Font
It turns the keyboard into the symbols of the conlang.

## Installation
Probably meson let me cook first sorry
